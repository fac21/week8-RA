### Questions

1. When we started up Vite, it created a new folder inside our folder with the files needed, however when we went to deploy on Netlify, we had an isssue because the files needed were in a folder, and not accesssible. If Vite or React creates a new folder for your app every time, how do you get round this when deploying to Netlify, rather than moving them out of the folder?
